## Installation
You will need to have node.js installed using an IDE of your choice, MySQL downloaded on your local computer, as well as downloading the necessary node_modules using "npm install" prior to setting up the database. Additionally, you will need a way to perform CRUD operations on the database, such as using the application Insomnia.
